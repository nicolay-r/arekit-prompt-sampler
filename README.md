As a task, [*Sentiment Attitude Extraction*](http://nlpprogress.com/russian/sentiment-analysis.html) 
is devoted to extraction of the sentiment connections from 
subjects towards objects mentioned in texts, usually analytical articles.
This task has been originally proposed and becomes a part of the studies in 
[RuSentRel](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/rusentrel)
dataset, in which
texts are written in Russian.

To address this limitation, this repository provides `googletrans`-based transfer for 
the result samples that might be composed for any other language you want!

## Installation

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

Download AREkit related data, from which `sources` are required:
```python
python -m arekit.download_data
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 translate.py --writer csv --source rusentrel --sampler bert \
                     --dest_lang en --docs_limit 1 --output_dir 'out'
```
In this example, we convert the RuSentRel collection, originally written in Russian, to the English version,
sampled for the BERT-based models, with samples limited by `limit` parameter
